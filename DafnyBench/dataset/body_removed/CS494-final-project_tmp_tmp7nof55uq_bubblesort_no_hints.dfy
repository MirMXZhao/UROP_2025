// predicate checks if elements of a are in ascending order, two additional conditions are added to allow us to sort in specific range within array
predicate sorted(a:array<int>, from:int, to:int)
  requires a != null; // requires array to have n amount of elements
  reads a; 
  requires 0 <= from <= to <= a.Length; // pre condition checks that from is the start of the range and to is the end of the range, requires values to be within 0 - a.Length
{}

//helps ensure swapping is valid, it is used inside the nested while loop to make sure linear order is being kept 
predicate pivot(a:array<int>, to:int, pvt:int)
  requires a != null; // requires array to have n amount of elements
  reads a;
  requires 0 <= pvt < to <= a.Length;
{}

// Here having the algorithm for the bubblesort

method BubbleSort (a: array<int>)
    requires a != null && a.Length > 0; // makes sure a is not empty and length is greater than 0
    modifies a; // as method runs, we are changing a
    ensures sorted(a, 0, a.Length); // makes sure elements of array a are sorted from 0 - a.Length
    ensures multiset(a[..]) == multiset(old(a[..])); // Since a is being modified, we deference the heap 
                                                      //and compare the previous elements to current elements.
